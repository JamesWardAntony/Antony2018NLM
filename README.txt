Collection Details:

These data include subjects from both conditions (SPL and CPL), all analysis scripts (MATLAB and R), plots that should be generated by the data, and all scripts + stimuli to run the experiment in Presentation. (Note that we have a closely related version of this experiment in MATLAB - PsychToolbox. We used Biosemi ActiveTwo with 64 electrodes to collect the data at both institutions (NU and PU). Shared data are preprocessed after down-sampling, filtering, and re-referencing. Sleep scores and 5-s epochs marked for rejection are included in each subject’s folder. Raw data are available upon request and simply omitted for the sake of size. 

Contents:
Overview: See Overview.pdf file for graphical overview of how all of the analysis scripts fit together. 

Behavioral: Behavioral data are included in their respective [subject]>behav folders. Their specifications are outlined in the relevant behavioral data processing scripts. 

Preprocessed: The preprocessed sleep data are included in the main folder (‘sleepInt.set’). Then the further processed data are within the [subject]>sleep folders, including
- sleep stages (‘stages.txt‘ and ‘[subject]stagesJWA.mat’)
- reject values for every 5 s throughout recording (‘reject.mat’)
- folders with data from continuous SOphase, quantized spindle detection scripts (Spindle_Detection_11_16_Molle), and quantized slow oscillations (SO_05_35)

Processed: .mat files within '4_18_2017' are processed by earlier files to speed up physiology analyses. See Overview.key and the associated scrips for more details. 

Exp files: The 'expfiles' folder contains files to run the experiment in the programming language, Presentation. Also contains all visual and auditory stimuli used in the experiment. 

RStuff: R code for running statistical analyses.
